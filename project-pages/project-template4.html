            Player1 will wear motion-capture suit. We will transmit the body data to the game scene 
            in real-time. The body will form the terrain in the game. Player2 will play the role of slime 
            mold to control the computer and use the body posture of player1 to pass through the 
            obstacles in the game.</div>
          <div class="body-text"><p>Story Background</p>
            After a nuclear war, humans almost became extinct due to their excessive dependence 
            on and abuse of nuclear energy. Highly intelligent slime molds became the new masters 
            of the planet and parasitized and enslaved all flora and fauna and humans. However, the 
            earth has been in a nuclear winter for decades, with no visible sun, torn land, and 
            polluted seas.
            The player controls the protagonist, a slime mold named No.996, who was sent by the 
            "Central" to an abandoned sea transfer station to restart the equipment and provide 
            energy for the group. It will manipulate a human "tool," numbered 007, to collect energy 
            fragments and restart the transfer station.</div>
